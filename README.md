# Movies-ETL

## Overview of Project
Amazing Prime is an up and coming streaming service that is looking to see which movies it wants to add onto it's service. Using data from both Wikipedia and Kaggle, we will present a list of movies, as well as what their ratings were, to prepare for a Hackathon. Presented in this project, we have shown the cleaning process of our data, as well as create a streamlined programming process so they can do this again in the future.
